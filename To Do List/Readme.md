# To-Do List Application

This repository contains a Kivy-based to-do list application built with Python. The app provides a simple graphical interface for managing tasks, featuring a form for adding new items and a dynamic list view for displaying them.

## Features

* Add New Tasks: Users can enter tasks into a text input field and submit them. The tasks are saved to a data.json file and the input field is cleared after submission.
* View Tasks: Tasks are displayed in a scrollable list that updates every second to reflect the latest data from data.json.
* Navigation: An intuitive menu allows users to switch between the task list view (HomeScreen) and the task entry form (AddScreen).

## Components

* AddNewForm: Handles user input and saves new tasks.
* MyRecycleView: Displays tasks in a scrollable view and refreshes periodically.
* Menu: Provides navigation between different screens.
* HomeScreen: Displays the list of tasks.
* AddScreen: Contains the form for adding new tasks.
* ScreenManagement: Manages the transitions between HomeScreen and AddScreen.

The .kv file defines the application's layout, utilizing Kivy's BoxLayout and RecycleBoxLayout for efficient display and organization. This project demonstrates Kivyâ€™s capabilities for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
